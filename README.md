## About icsConverter
It can be a major hassle to take a spreadsheet of events and import them to a calendar. This Python script intends to make that process easier by converting a .csv file to an .ics file that can be imported by most modern calendaring apps.

The spreadsheet must be meticulously formatted and exported to the .csv. If I'm going to be honest, the formatting is the hard part; the task handled by this app can be done easily enough by uploading the .csv to Google Calendar and re-downloading as .ics. However, for those that would rather not use Google Calendar for the conversion, this should do the trick.
